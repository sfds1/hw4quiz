## Password Generator - Homework #3 - Javascript

## Description 

This site generates a random password based on user entered criteria.  The length has to be between 8 and 128 characters and have at least 1 option from numbers, lowercase, uppercase and special characters.

This would be something for employees with higher level access so security should be stronger.

## Business Context

For companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, weak passwords can pose a real security threat. An application that can generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly saves employees time and ensures secure access to data.

## Questions

For Javascript

1. Is it "better" to use checkboxes and ask all at once versus prompts?  Maybe developer preference?

2. Why if I use let inside while or if statements the variable is not the same color as the other variables? 
   If I change to var then the color matches for all variables

3.  Is it better to use string or array for the password?
  Answer, maybe: which option is slower/faster (runtime) to process and/or takes up more/less storage (space complexity)
  Maybe also what want to do with information later.  Certain functions work on certain types
